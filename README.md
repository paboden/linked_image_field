# Linked Image Field

This creates an image field with a url field (and additional options) for automatically creating an image that is linked to a url.

Much of the code is based on the image module and inspired by the linkimagefield module. I am hoping to combine this modules code into linkimagefield once refined and combining with field slideshow module is completed.
